<h3>Colors are the absolute worst thing to work with in any media.</h3>
<p>There are so many problems when you deal with colors</p>
<ol class="solid">
<li>They're hard to match for no reason at all.</li>
<li>No one has the same opinions about colors, so someone will always not like it.</li>
<li>Every color has an opposite that looks good, but the probolem is shades. No shade looks good against the wrong shade.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are all the problems I'm having with colors at the moment, so I just decided to pick a bunch of pretty colors and put them togehter."
