<p> Dear Friend, </p>
<p> My cat Fuji likes to make biscuits.</p>
<p> Fuji does not seem to understand no matter how many times I tell him that I am a person and not dough to be used to make biscuits.</p>
<p> I am afraid that the longer he continues to knead me, the harder it will be to tell him. I am at a dead end.</p>
<p> It has come to my realization that maybe I am dough, and he is somehow much smarter than me. </p>
<p> It has also crossed my mind that maybe I should talk in his own language to get it across, but alas, it has not worked either.</p>
<p> If you do not hear from me, I fear that I might be at my cat's mercy. Please do not look for me. </p>
<p>Until the next letter or maybe not, <br /> the cat's human</p>
<!-- Unfortunately for the person writing the letter, They were looked for aas they did not respond to their friend's worried email. THey were found smothered in cats as the kneaded. Scientists are unable to tell how their body turned to dough, just that it did. As It turns out, the cat was not amking biscuits, but instead, trying to show their love. How untterly insane.-->
<!-- Side note left by very concerned friend of the worried friend who then took in the named cat and has not been heard from in three weeks. As such they will be looked for as well. Goodbye. Will keep you updated. -->
