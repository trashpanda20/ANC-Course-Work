<h1 class="outset">Knitting</h1>
<p class="inset">I'm learning to knit, and it's kind of hard. There's a pair of needles, so that means you can't just use your hands to thread around the yarn. I'm doing pretty well, and my scarf so far is about the size of my hand.</p>
<ul class="a">
<li>I am amking a scarf for my mom first.</li>
<li>Next will be a scarf for my dad.</li>
<li>Then I'm goiong to learn how to make beanies so that I can make myself a very soft pink beanie.</li>
<li>Last, I'll make a very pretty blanket that i'm noit sure about on colors yet.</li>
</ul>
<p class="inset">I've got a long to due list, but at least I'll be great at knitting in the end.</p>
